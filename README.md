# Systemhacks-Routine-Roulette
## Inspiration
One of our members often uses his phone's notepad app to time block his goals and routine for the day, he just types them down in sequence and tries to work through the tasks. We thought we could transform that process into a simple app, with a chaotic twist.

## What it does
Routine Roulette lets the user add tasks, drag them to re-order their sequence, and delete them in 3 sections of their day (morning, noon, evening). It's a simple app that has the ability to do wonders if used wisely. To add some chaos, the app also has a "Chaos" button that shuffles the tasks within sections and gives the user a new adventure. 

## How I built it
We used React.JS/CSS/HTML to implement, design, and build the web app. To deploy the web app, we used github pages and these tools were initially hard to use, but gave us a very smooth experience overall.

## Challenges I ran into
In the beginning, we planned to make this app using React Native, for it to be available to mobile devices. However, due to the uncertainties and lack of experience with the framework, we switched to ReactJS, where we are more experienced. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We successfully implemented the dragging feature of the web-app, where elements can be dragged around in a same task component. Apart from that, the CHAOS button can make the schedule become chaotic, making it a "Russian-Roulette" like scheduling app, when your schedule is unpredictable.

## What I learned
We learned on how to work as a team to prevent merging conflicts by using liveshare. As well as how to debug efficiently on ReactJS and using the external library react beautiful drag-n-drop. 

## What's next for Routine Roulette
Routine Roulette will definitely be launch as a mobile app in the future.
